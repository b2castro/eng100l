Hey Software Team some basic guidelines I think will make collaboration easy:

1. Comment your name next to your code so we know who to ask for help later
2. Add descriptions to your code
3. Always pull from master right before you push to master
4. Have descriptive commit messages
5. Never push code that doesn't work or that breaks the app
